    <div class="m-4 text-lg">I'm chronically inconsistent.
    </div>
    <div class="m-4 text-sm font-extralight">Being consistent at one thing is hard enough. Being consistent at all the things seems impossible.
    </div>
    <div class="m-4 text-lg">If I do manage consistency at one thing, I lose sight of all the other things.
    </div>
    <div class="m-4 text-sm font-extralight">Linear absorbtion, one thing at a time. Strange, wonderful blinkers that help me go deep, but make all the other things fade.
    </div>
    <div class="m-4 text-lg">This can cause problems.
    </div>
    <div class="m-4 text-sm font-extralight">To not lose sight of all the things, I need to see all the things. I need to connect daily, be vigilant to every thing. If I don't connect daily, weeks slide by.
    </div>
    <div class="m-4 text-lg">So I built ninepanels.com to help  keep all my things visible.
    </div>
    <div class="m-4 text-sm font-extralight">(well, up to nine of them)
