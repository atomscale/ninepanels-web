          <div class="">I've always found being consistent at one thing quite hard.
          </div>
          <div class="">Being consistent at all the things
            seems impossible!
          </div>
          <div class="">For me, if consistency is attained in one thing, sight is lost of all the other things.
          </div>
          <div class="">This can cause problems.
          </div>
          <div class="">So, I built a simple app to help keep all my important things visible and keep an eye on my consistency. (well, up to nine
            of them...)
          </div>
          <div class="">I told my friend about it, he said it might be useful to him, and it has been.
          </div>
          <div class="">So I thought, let's make it free to everyone, forever (and never, ever run ads!).
          </div>
          <div class="">So here we are, at ninepanels.com.
          </div>
          <div class=""> It's open source, still early and unfinished. Get in touch with feedback or ideas:
