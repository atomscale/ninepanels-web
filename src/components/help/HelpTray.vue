    <div class="text-xl text-np-base font-bold ">1. Establish your daily balance:</div>
    <div class="">Create panels for important areas of your life. </div>
    <div class="">You decide what a panel means to you. Most people pick areas 'above' the level of to-do lists and 'getting things done'.
      Perhaps think "life-level" and "meaningful engagement" not "frenetic activity" and "completion".</div>
    <div class="">A good question to ask yourself is: "What makes a great day for me?" </div>
    <div class="font-bold">But it's up to you.</div>
    <div class="text-xl text-np-base font-bold">2. Tap:</div>
    <div class="">Simply tap the panel to see your recent consitency.</div>
    <div class="">Tap the panel again to complete or uncomplete it. </div>
    <div class="">Don't worry if you miss a day, this is about the long-term. </div>

    <div class="">You decide when a panel should be 'complete' (and what that means).</div>
    <div class="text-xl text-np-base font-bold">3. Observe your patterns:</div>
    <div class="">This is where perception meets reality.  </div>

    <div class="">

      Filter timeframes or tap infinity âˆž to see everything.
    </div>
    <div class="">Vertical patterns can be as illuminating as horizontal.  </div>
    <div class="pb-10 font-extrabold">Good luck.  </div>
